# BDO Coupon Bot

A simple Discord bot that searches for Black Desert coupons once in a while, and broadcasts them to subscribers.

## Usage

You can run the bot either with Docker for convenience or natively as well.

### With Docker
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a new filed called "discord_token", and paste your discord token here
3. Run "docker compose up --detach"

## Without Docker
1. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
2. Clone the repo in the destination of your choice
3. Create a new filed called "discord_token", and paste your discord token here
4. Start with launch.sh (this will also pull the latest changes)
